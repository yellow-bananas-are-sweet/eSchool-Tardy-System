eSchool Tardy Recorder — Production-Ready Python App

A clean, production-style Python desktop app that polls the eSchool (eSD GURU) API every 5 seconds, captures scan/tardy events in real time (Mon–Fri), and logs them to a single worksheet in a weekly Excel file. Includes a small GUI for live logs and start/stop control.
