## Overview  
This project allows school staff to quickly generate and print tardy passes for students by scanning a student’s ID barcode. The system retrieves student information from a database, adds the current date and time, and previews the pass on a GUI before printing.  

- Generates a pass in less than 10 seconds (compared to about 1 minute manually)  
- Designed for schools with 3,200+ students  
- Eliminates manual data entry — staff only need to scan and print
